## Game Design and Development:

This project was developed as a student project to demonstrate skills in:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Perl
- Decision-making algorithms and random events
- Interactive game design with multiple outcomes
- Managing game states such as health, coins, and inventory

## Acknowledgements:
- **Perl Documentation**: The official [Perl docs](https://perldoc.perl.org/) were a huge help during the development.
